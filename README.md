# combining styles and scripts 

combine all the styles and scripts that are not in visible area while loading and put them in defer or create a function that exectes after the website loaded completely and push those styles and scripting so that the performance will be increaded 

## Don't leave Anchor Tage Empty
`<a> something </a>`
This will be a bad practise instead use p tag or use `href` inside `<a>` tag
